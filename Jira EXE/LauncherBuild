To wrap the dialog box script (Python) and the PowerShell script together into an executable (EXE) file, you can use a tool like PyInstaller to create an executable for the Python script and then use a PowerShell script to launch both the Python executable and the PowerShell script.
Here's a step-by-step guide:

First, make sure you have PyInstaller installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

----------

pip install pyinstaller

----------

Create your Python script for the dialog box and save it with a .py extension (e.g., dialog_box.py).
Create your PowerShell script that will be executed after the dialog box is closed. Save it with a .ps1 extension (e.g., powershell_script.ps1).
Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your Python script is located.
Run the following command to create an executable for your Python script:

----------

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed dialog_box.py

----------

This command will generate an executable file named dialog_box.exe in the dist folder.
Create a new PowerShell script (e.g., launcher.ps1) that will launch both the Python executable and the PowerShell script. Here's an example:
powershell

----------

# Run the Python executable
Start-Process -FilePath ".\dist\dialog_box.exe" -Wait

# Run the PowerShell script
& ".\powershell_script.ps1"

----------

This script first launches the dialog_box.exe executable and waits for it to complete. After the dialog box is closed, it then runs the powershell_script.ps1 script.
Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your launcher.ps1 script is located.
Run the following command to create an executable for the launcher script:

----------

powershell -Command "Invoke-PS2EXE .\launcher.ps1 .\launcher.exe"

----------

This command uses the ps2exe module to convert the PowerShell script into an executable file named launcher.exe.
Note: If you don't have the ps2exe module installed, you can install it by running the following command in a PowerShell window with administrator privileges:

----------

Install-Module -Name ps2exe

----------

After running the command, you will have an executable file named launcher.exe in the same directory as your launcher.ps1 script.
You can now distribute the launcher.exe file along with the dist folder (containing dialog_box.exe) and the powershell_script.ps1 file to users. When users run the launcher.exe file, it will first launch the dialog box, and then after the dialog box is closed, it will execute the PowerShell script.

Note: Make sure that the paths to the dialog_box.exe and powershell_script.ps1 files in the launcher.ps1 script are correct relative to the location of the launcher.exe file.
Also, keep in mind that the user's system must have PowerShell installed to run the PowerShell script. If PowerShell is not installed, the launcher may fail to execute the PowerShell script.
This is a general approach to wrap the dialog box script and the PowerShell script together into an executable file. You may need to adjust the paths and commands based on your specific requirements and file locations.
